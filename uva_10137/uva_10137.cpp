/* UVa problem: <10137>
 *
 * Topic: other
 *
 * Level: challenging
 * 
 * Brief problem description: 
 *
 *   Input
Standard input will contain the information for several trips. The information for each trip consists of
a line containing a positive integer, n, the number of students on the trip, followed by n lines of input,
each containing the amount, in dollars and cents, spent by a student. There are no more than 1000
students and no student spent more than $10,000.00. A single line containing 0 follows the information
for the last trip.
Output
For each trip, output a line stating the total amount of money, in dollars and cents, that must be
exchanged to equalize the studentsâ€™ costs
