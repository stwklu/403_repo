/* UVa problem: <136>
 *
 * Topic: Dynamic Programming
 *
 * Level: challenging
 * 
 * Brief problem description: 
 *
 *   Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5.
 * 	 find and print the 1500â€™th ugly number.
 *
 * Solution Summary:
 *
 *   Dynamic Programming. Keep pointer for 2, 3, 5 that point to the last ugly number that product of that ugly number and pointer is just over n-1 ugly number.
 *	 So each recursion we only search for a small amunt of candidate and skip useless step.
 *
 * Used Resources:
 *
 *   StackOverflow
 *
 * I hereby certify that I have produced the following solution myself
 * using only the resources listed above in accordance with the CMPUT
 * 403 collaboration policy.
